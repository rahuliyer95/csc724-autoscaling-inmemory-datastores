# CSC 724: Auto-Scaling In-Memory Data Stores

This project includes the different modules to demonstrate our work on auto-scaling Redis nodes based on its workload.

## Infrastructure Setup

To setup the infrastructure follow the instructions inside the [vcl-setup](./vcl-setup), [redis-docker](./redis-docker), [scale-node-docker](./scale-node-docker), [workload-docker](./workload-docker) folders.

To install the prediction engine follow the instructions inside the [prediction](./prediction) folder.

The current system only supports [Azure](https://azure.com), so you need azure credentials for things to work properly.
